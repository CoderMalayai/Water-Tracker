Water-Tracker

Inspiration for Tracker:

I am a person who doesn't drink alot of water for many reasons. I wanted a fun way to drink water but it also track how much I would be improving each day. I didn't think there would be an app for it but there it was, my dear friend of mine sent me a link to a water-tracker app that involved planting/watering when you tracked your water. This made me think of making a water-tracker but into a app game.

How to use Water-Tracker:
1: DRINK WATER (1CUP/8OZ)
2: Whenever you get to drink your first amount you will be able to hit the CLICK ME to add to your tracker.

This tracker in the future will have a stopping point and a refresh number function.

Technologies Used to Build the Tracker:

I used languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used these languages to both build the frontend and backend of my Water-Tracker. My backend is handling the logic and storing it into Postgres. I used Bootstrap for most of my styling. Images from canva that I found.

Outstanding Bugs or Unfinished Functionality:

1) I was ensure in the future that there is a login and sign in function to track on different accounts.
2) I wanna have a actually game built into the water-tracker.
3) Wanna forsure have a PLAY screen that goes into the game/tracker instead of just being the front page.
4) I wanna add fun facts to the front screen and everytime you refresh theres a new fact.
